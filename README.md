The project consists of multiple classes and interfaces designed to facilitate various functionalities related to flight booking, weather checking, itinerary planning, and user interaction. Here's a breakdown of the main components and features:

Interfaces and Abstract Classes:

The city interface defines methods related to different cities like Goa, Bengaluru, and Chennai.
The overall interface defines a method for printing output messages.
Classes:

itenary: This class implements the city interface and provides methods to plan itineraries for different cities based on weather conditions and user preferences.
SmartCity: This class extends an abstract class outputscreen and implements the overall interface. It serves as the main class of the application, handling user interaction and coordinating various functionalities.
Features:

Flight Booking: Users can view available flights, select their boarding and destination cities, choose departure dates, and finalize bookings.
Weather Checking: The application checks the current weather conditions of specified locations using the WeatherAPI service.
Itinerary Planning: Based on the weather conditions, users can plan their day, including activities like selecting breakfast, lunch, dinner spots, and other attractions to visit.
User Interaction: The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with, guiding them through the process of flight booking and itinerary planning.
OTP Generation: For security purposes during flight booking, the application generates a one-time password (OTP) for authentication.
Functionality:

Users can book flights between different cities, view available flight options, and select their preferred flights based on timing and cost.
The application suggests activities and places to visit based on the weather conditions in the selected city, allowing users to plan their itinerary accordingly.
